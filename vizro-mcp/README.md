# Vizro MCP server

Vizro-MCP is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, which works alongside a LLM to help you create Vizro dashboards and charts.

## Features of Vizro-MCP

Vizro-MCP provides tools and templates to create a functioning Vizro chart or dashboard step by step. Benefits include:

‚úÖ One consistent framework for charts and dashboards with one common design language.

‚úÖ Validated config output that is readable and easy to alter or maintain.

‚úÖ Live preview of the dashboard to iterate the design until the dashboard is perfect.

‚úÖ Use of local or remote datasets simply by providing a path or URL.

### Without Vizro-MCP

Without Vizro-MCP, if you try to make a dashboard using an LLM, it could choose any framework, and use it without specific guidance, design principles, or consistency. The results are:

‚ùå A random choice of frontend framework or charting library.

‚ùå A vibe-coded mess that may or may not run, but certainly is not very maintainable.

‚ùå No way to easily preview the dashboard.

‚ùå No easy way to connect to real data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Get started

If you are a **developer** and need instructions for running Vizro-MCP from source, skip to the end of this page to [Development or running from source](#development-or-running-from-source).

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/downloads)

In principle, the Vizro MCP server works with _any_ MCP enabled LLM applications but we recommend Claude Desktop or Cursor as popular choices.

> üêõ **Note:** There are currently some known issues with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but we are working on this and hope to have Copilot working soon.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** In some hosts (like Claude Desktop) the free plan might be less performant, which may cause issues when the request is too complex. In cases where the request causes the UI to crash, opt for using a paid plan, or reduce your request's complexity.

## Setup Instructions

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude</strong></summary>

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` [found via Developer Settings](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user#2-add-the-filesystem-mcp-server).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vizro-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "vizro-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** In some cases you may need to provide the full path to your `uvx` executable, so instead of `uvx` would use something like `/Users/<your-username>/.local/bin/uvx`. To discover the path of `uvx` on your machine, in your terminal app, type `which uvx`.

If you are using Claude Desktop, restart it, and after a few moments, you should see the vizro-mcp menu when opening the settings/context menu:

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong></summary>

Add the following to `mcp.json` [found via the Cursor Settings](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuration-locations).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vizro-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "vizro-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** In some cases you may need to provide the full path to your `uvx` executable, so instead of `uvx` would use something like `/Users/<your-username>/.local/bin/uvx`. To discover the path of `uvx` on your machine, in your terminal app, type `which uvx`.

Similarly, when using Cursor, after a short pause, you should see a green light in the MCP menu:

</details>

In principle, the Vizro MCP server works with _any_ MCP enabled LLM applications but we recommend Claude Desktop or Cursor as popular choices. Different AI tools may use different setup methods or connection settings. Check each tool's docs for details.

## üíª Usage

### Use prompt templates to get specific dashboards quickly

Prompt templates are not available in all MCP hosts, but when they are, you can use them to get specific dashboards quickly. To access them (e.g. in Claude Desktop), click on the plus icon below the chat, and choose _`Add from vizro-mcp`_.

<img src="assets/claude_prompt.png" alt="Claude Desktop MCP Server Icon" width="300"/>

The **easiest** way to get started with Vizro dashboards is to choose the template `create_starter_dashboard` and just send the prompt. This will create a super simple dashboard with one page, one chart, and one filter. Take it from there!

### Create a Vizro dashboard based on local or remote data

You can also ask the LLM to create specific dashboards based on local or remote data if you already have an idea of what you want. Example prompts could be:

> _Create a Vizro dashboard with one page, a scatter chart, and a filter based on `<insert absolute file path or public URL>` data._

> _Create a simple two page Vizro dashboard, with first page being a correlation analysis of `<insert absolute file path or public URL>` data, and the second page being a map plot of `<insert absolute file path or public URL>` data_

You can find a set of sample CSVs to try out in the [Plotly repository](https://github.com/plotly/datasets/tree/master).

You can even ask for a dashboard without providing data:

> _Create a Vizro dashboard with one page, a scatter chart, and a filter._

In general, it helps to specify Vizro in the prompt and to keep it as precise (and simple) as possible.

### Get a live preview of your dashboard

When the LLM chooses to use the tool `validate_model_config`, and the tool executes successfully, the LLM will return a link to a live preview of the dashboard if only public data accessed via URL is used. By default, the LLM will even open the link in your browser for you unless you tell it not to. In Claude Desktop, you can see the output of the tool by opening the tool collapsible and scrolling down to the very bottom.

<img src="assets/claude_validate.png" width="300"/>

You can also ask the model to give you the link, but it will attempt to regenerate it, which is very error prone and slow.

### Create Vizro charts

If you don't want to create an entire Vizro dashboard, you can still use Vizro-MCP to create the code for a single chart. If you're not sure what kind of chart you want, check out the [Vizro Visual Vocabulary](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vizro/demo-visual-vocabulary) for ideas.

The **easiest** way to create a Vizro chart is to choose the template `create_vizro_chart` and just send the prompt. This will create a simple chart that you can alter. Take it from there!

Alternatively, you can just ask in the chat, for example:

> _Create a scatter based on the iris dataset._

> _Create a bar chart based on `<insert absolute file path or public URL>` data._

## üîç Transparency and trust

MCP servers are a relatively new concept, and it is important to be transparent about what the tools are capable of so you can make an informed choice as a user. Overall, the Vizro MCP server only reads data, and never writes, deletes or modifies any data on your machine.

In general the most critical part of the process is the `load_and_analyze_data` tool. This tool, running on your machine, will load local or remote data into a pandas DataFrame and provide a detailed analysis of its structure and content. It only uses `pd.read_xxx`, so in general there is no need to worry about privacy or data security.

The second most critical part is the `validate_model_config` tool. This tool will attempt to instantiate the Vizro model configuration and return the Python code and visualization link for valid configurations. If the configuration is valid, it will also return and attempt to open a link to a live preview of the dashboard, which will take you to [PyCafe](https://py.cafe). If you don't want to open the link, you can tell the LLM to not do so.

## Available Tools (if client allows)

The Vizro MCP server provides the following tools. In general you should not need to use them directly, but in special cases you could ask the LLM to call them directly to help it find its way.

- `get_vizro_chart_or_dashboard_plan` - Get a structured step-by-step plan for creating either a chart or dashboard. Provides guidance on the entire creation process.
- `get_model_JSON_schema` - Retrieves the complete JSON schema for any specified Vizro model, useful for understanding required and optional parameters.
- `validate_model_config` - Tests Vizro model configurations by attempting to instantiate them. Returns Python code and visualization links for valid configurations.
- `load_and_analyze_csv` - Loads a CSV file from a local path or URL into a pandas DataFrame and provides detailed analysis of its structure and content.
- `validate_chart_code` - Validates the code created for a chart and returns feedback on its correctness.
- `get_sample_data_info` - Provides information about sample datasets that can be used for testing and development.

## Available Prompts (if client allows)

- `create_starter_dashboard` - Use this prompt template to get started with Vizro dashboards.
- `create_EDA_dashboard` - Use this prompt template to create an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) dashboard based on a local or remote CSV dataset.
- `create_vizro_chart` - Use this prompt template to create a Vizro styled plotly chart based on a local or remote CSV dataset.

## Development or running from source

If you are a developer, or if you are running Vizro-MCP from source, you need to clone the Vizro repo. To configure the Vizro MCP server details:

**For Claude**: Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` [found via Developer Settings](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user#2-add-the-filesystem-mcp-server):

**For Cursor**: Add the following to `mcp.json` [found via the Cursor Settings](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuration-locations):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vizro-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "<PATH TO VIZRO>/vizro-mcp/",
        "vizro-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<PATH TO VIZRO>` with the actual path to your Vizro repository. You may also need to provide the full path to your `uv` executable, so instead of `"uv"` you would use something like `"/Users/<your-username>/.local/bin/uv"`. To discover the path of `uv` on your machine, in your terminal app, type `which uv`.

<summary><strong>Warning and safety usage for generative AI models</strong></summary>

Vizro-MCP is used by generative AI models because large language models (LLMs) represent significant advancements in the AI field. However, as with any powerful tool, there are potential risks associated with connecting to a generative AI model.

We recommend users research and understand the selected model before using Vizro-MCP.

Users are encouraged to treat AI-generated content as supplementary, always apply human judgment, approach with caution, review the relevant disclaimer page, and consider the following:

<ol>
<li>Hallucination and misrepresentation</li>
Generative models can potentially generate information while appearing factual, being entirely fictitious or misleading.

The vendor models might lack real-time knowledge or events beyond its last updates. Vizro-MCP output may vary and you should always verify critical information. It is the user's responsibility to discern the accuracy, consistent, and reliability of the generated content.

<li>Unintended and sensitive output</li>
The outputs from these models can be unexpected, inappropriate, or even harmful. Users as human in the loop is an essential part. Users must check and interpret the final output. It is necessary to approach the generated content with caution, especially when shared or applied in various contexts.

<li>Data privacy</li>
Your data is sent to model vendors if you connect to LLMs via their APIs. For example, if you connect to the model from OpenAI, your data will be sent to OpenAI via their API. Users should be cautious about sharing or inputting any personal or sensitive information.

<li>Bias and fairness</li>
Generative AI can exhibit biases present in their training data. Users need to be aware of and navigate potential biases in generated outputs and be cautious when interpreting the generated content.

<li>Malicious use</li>
These models can be exploited for various malicious activities. Users should be cautious about how and where they deploy and access such models.
</ol>
It's crucial for users to remain informed, cautious, and ethical in their applications.
