# How to use local or remote data

You can ask the LLM to create specific dashboards based on local or remote data if you already have an idea of what you want. Example prompts could be:

> _Create a Vizro dashboard with one page, a scatter chart, and a filter based on `<insert absolute file path or public URL>` data._

> _Create a simple two page Vizro dashboard, with first page being a correlation analysis of `<insert absolute file path or public URL>` data, and the second page being a map plot of `<insert absolute file path or public URL>` data_

You can find a set of sample CSVs to try out in the [Plotly repository](https://github.com/plotly/datasets/tree/master).

You can even ask for a dashboard without providing data:

> _Create a Vizro dashboard with one page, a scatter chart, and a filter._

In general, it helps to specify Vizro in the prompt and to keep it as precise (and simple) as possible.
