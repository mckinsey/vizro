# FAQs

## Do I need to install Vizro?

No, you do not need to install Vizro.

## Can I use ChatGPT?

You can use any LLM model with Vizro-MCP as long as the MCP host offers it. At the time of writing, the desktop ChatGPT app is not MCP-enabled, but this may change in the future.

## Which MCP host should I use, Cursor or Claude Desktop?

At the time of writing, we have found that Anthropic models tend to work best with Vizro-MCP. You can use them with Claude Desktop or Cursor.

We advise you to use Claude Desktop if you want to work with public data stored remotely, and use PyCafe to view the charts or dashboards that Vizro-MCP creates.

We recommend you Cursor if you want to work within an IDE to adjust code yourself, and when you need to work with local data.

## Can Vizro-MCP create custom CSS?

Vizro-MCP is designed to start you creating Vizro dashboards and charts based on the core Vizro features. It is not designed to replace a human developer when going beyond the core features, e.g. when building an application that requires custom CSS or bespoke Dash components.
