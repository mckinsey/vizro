# FAQs

## Do I need to install Vizro?

No, you do not need to install Vizro.

## Can I use ChatGPT?

You can use any LLM model with Vizro-MCP as long as the MCP host offers it. However, Anthropic models tend to work best. At the time of writing, the desktop ChatGPT app is not MCP-enabled, but this may change in the future.

## Can Vizro-MCP create custom CSS?

Vizro-MCP is designed to start you creating Vizro dashboards and charts based on the core Vizro features. It is not designed to replace a human developer when going beyond the core features, e.g. when building an application that requires custom CSS or bespoke Dash components.
