# Cursor and Vizro-MCP tutorial

## About this tutorial

This tutorial uses a public dataset about winners of the [Booker prize](https://thebookerprizes.com/booker-prize/about-the-booker-prize), which is a literary award conferred each year for the "best sustained work of fiction written in English and published in the UK and Ireland".

To work through the tutorial, you'll need to download the `.xlsx` dataset of [Booker prize winners from 1969 to 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rowrowrowyourboat72/booker-prize-winners-1969-2023?resource=download) from Kaggle. The tutorial illustrates how to work with the data locally. It uses Cursor to generate an initial set of Python chart code, then modifies the code by hand, although Cursor's guidance is also available. The prompts and chart output at the time of writing are shown to illustrate the process. The nature of working with an LLM is that your output may be slightly different.

## Set up Vizro-MCP

If you haven't already done so, follow our instructions to [set up Vizro-MCP to work with Cursor](../guides/set-up-vizro-mcp-with-cursor.md), which this tutorial uses.

Alternatively, you can [set up Claude Desktop](../guides/set-up-vizro-mcp-with-claude.md), or [set up VS Code](../guides/set-up-vizro-mcp-with-vscode.md), or use our [basic setup configuration](../guides/set-up-vizro-mcp-basics.md) for your preferred host.

To check that Cursor is correctly set up to use Vizro-MCP, pass in a prompt:

```text
Can you access Vizro-MCP?
```

You should receive a response similar to the following:

> Yes! I do have access to Vizro-MCP tools. I can see several Vizro MCP functions available that allow me to help you create charts and dashboards using Vizro.

## Strategy

There is no single correct way to use Vizro-MCP, and the style of interaction also depends on the underlying LLM that you have chosen. Assuming you are using Cursor, select **Open Folder** from the **File** menu. Navigate to the folder you've stored the data, which is where you'll create Vizro code to visualize it.

## Prompt to generate a Vizro chart

As a first prompt, type something similar to the following:

```text
Use Vizro-MCP to build a butterfly chart for the
Booker Prize Dataset Final.xlsx using GENDER
(M on left hand side, F on right hand side),
with the count of each gender for each AGE BIN.
```

Here is the prompt as it was typed. Before you submit it, we recommend you check that the model selected is **`claude-4-sonnet`** and the mode is **Agent**:

Running this prompt in Cursor, we saw the following response. You should see something similar:

### Save the code

Ask Cursor to save the code into a `.py` file. For convenience, save it in the same directory as the data:

```text
Can you save the code into a .py file in this folder
as booker_prize_butterfly_chart.py?
```

### Execute the code

Open a new terminal within Cursor from the **Terminal** menu and navigate to the code and data directory within it. Create a new virtual environment to run the Vizro code, and install the necessary dependencies. In the below, we use the [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv venv cursorenv
source cursorenv/bin/activate
uv pip install pandas
uv pip install openpyxl
uv pip install vizro
```

Next, if the final line of code (`fig.show()`) is commented out, uncomment it so the chart is displayed, and save the code change.

In the terminal, type the following to execute the code:

```bash
python booker_prize_butterfly_chart.py
```

The output we received was as follows:

![](../../assets/images/cursor-tutorial3.png)

## Code iteration by hand

At first sight, the butterfly chart is already almost complete, but in the code we received, there was a missing line that meant that the number of women in each age bin was missing. It is possible to ask Cursor to make a fix, but it is a trivial change to make manually.

We added this line in the `fig.add_trace()` call (see a [later section for the complete code](#final-chart-code)).

```python
text = [abs(val) for val in female_values]
```

Executing the chart again, we received the following:

![](../../assets/images/cursor-tutorial4.png)

## Code iteration with Cursor

We will now modify the code again, but since this is a more complex change, we can ask Cursor to do it:

```text
Can you change the hovertext on each bar to list
each WINNER and NOVEL that falls into that bin?
```

When we submitted the prompt, Cursor spent some time working through the changes, and finally returned this information:

![](../../assets/images/cursor-tutorial4.5.png)

Re-running the code showed the following:

![](../../assets/images/cursor-tutorial5.png)

## Final iteration

The chart is looking great. We will make a final tweak to change the color of the female bin to make it pink (hex code #ff0eef). We manually modified the `marker_color` specification in line 107, and saved the code. Re-running it gave the following:

![](../../assets/images/cursor-tutorial6.png)

Our chart is complete!

## Final chart code

When you are happy with the chart, you can store the code, for example, in GitHub. Here it is for reference:

## Save the prompt for your dashboard

You can ask Cursor to give you a comprehensive prompt to store alongside the code for future reference.

```text
Can you give me the text of a complete prompt that would
lead you to generate this chart with Vizro-MCP?
```

This is the output we received:

> Use Vizro-MCP to build a butterfly chart using Booker Prize Dataset Final.xlsx. The chart should show GENDER distribution with males (M) on the left-hand side and females (F) on the right-hand side, displaying the count of each gender for each AGE BIN.

> Requirements:

> - Use AGE BIN column for grouping (not AGE WHEN WON)

- Male bars should appear on the left side in blue color
- Female bars should appear on the right side in magenta color (#ff0eef)
- Include detailed hover text that shows the actual WINNER names and NOVEL titles for each bar
- The hover text should list each winner and their novel that falls into that specific age bin and gender combination
- Chart title should be "Booker Prize Winners by Gender and Age Bin"
- Y-axis should show "Age Bin" and X-axis should show "Count"
- Use categorical y-axis ordering for age bins
- Save the complete code as a .py file in the current folder
- The file should include proper documentation, imports, and example usage code
- Make sure the chart displays immediately when the script is run (fig.show())

## Summary

Congratulations! You have seen how to work with Vizro-MCP and Cursor to build a Vizro chart. The chart is a simple example, but can be customized or added to a Vizro dashboard alongside additional charts, controls, or customizations, as described in the [Vizro documentation](https://vizro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). You can also use Vizro-MCP with Cursor to help you achieve further customizations or create a dashboard with this chart.

To learn more about the main elements of Vizro dashboard code, we recommend you work through the introductory ["Explore Vizro" tutorial](https://vizro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/tutorials/explore-components/). The tutorial, and accompanying video, will enable you to explore the dashboard code generated by Vizro-MCP and give you ideas of how to modify it by hand rather than through a prompt, should you prefer to fine-tune it manually.
