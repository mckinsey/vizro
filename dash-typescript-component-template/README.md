# Usage

To use this template:

1. Install the requirements:
   ```shell
   pip install cookiecutter
   ```
   NodeJS is also required, install `nvm` to get the appropriate node version.
3. Run cookiecutter on the template repo:
   ```shell
   cookiecutter gh:plotly/dash-typescript-component-template
    ```
3. Answer the questions about the project.
    - `project_name`: This is the "human-readable" name of your project. For example, "Dash Core Components".
    - `project_shortname`: is derived from the project name, it is the name of the "Python library" for your project. By default, this is generated from your `project_name` by lowercasing the name and replacing spaces & `-` with underscores. For example, for "Dash Core Components" this would be "dash_core_components".
    - `component_name`: This is the name of the initial component that is generated. As a JavaScript class name it should be in PascalCase. defaults to the PascalCase version of `project_shortname`.
    - `jl_prefix`: Optional prefix for Julia components. For example, `dash_core_components` uses "dcc" so the Python `dcc.Input` becomes `dccInput` in Julia, and `dash_table` uses "dash" to make `dashDataTable`.
    - `r_prefix`: Optional prefix for R components. For example, `dash_core_components` uses "dcc" so the Python `dcc.Input` becomes `dccInput` in R, and `dash_table` uses "dash" to make `dashDataTable`.
    - `author_name` and `author_email`: for package.json and DESCRIPTION (for R) metadata.
    - `github_org`: If you plan to push this to GitHub, enter the organization or username that will own it (for URLs to the project homepage and bug report page)
    - `description`: the project description, included in package.json.
    - `license`: License type for the component library. Plotly recommends the MIT license, but you should read the generated LICENSE file carefully to make sure this is right for you.
    - `publish_on_npm`: Set to false to only serve locally from the package data.
4. The project will be generated in a folder named with your `project_shortname`.
5. Follow the directions in the generated README to start developing your new Dash component.
