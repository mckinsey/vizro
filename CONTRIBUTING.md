# Contributing guidelines

Contributions of all experience levels are welcome! If you're interested in making a contribution,
please refer to our [Contributing Guide](https://vizro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/explanation/contributing/) for more information.

The easiest way to get up and running quickly is to [open the repository in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=626855142). This will create a temporary development environment with all the necessary configurations, making it especially convenient for tasks like reviewing pull requests.
