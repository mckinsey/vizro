    """`_AbstractAction` to be used in an `actions` field.

    To use this class, you must subclass it and define `function` and `outputs` to make a concrete action class. All
    built in actions follow this pattern, and it's also possible for user-defined actions. This class is not relevant
    for user-defined actions using `@capture("action")`.

    When subclassing, you can optionally define model fields. These can be either static or runtime arguments and
    define the configuration that a user specifies to use the action:

      * static arguments, e.g. `file_format = "csv"`, are fixed upfront and do not change depending on the state of the
      dashboard.
      * runtime arguments depend on the state of the running dashboard on the user's screen. These correspond to Dash
      States, e.g. `country="dropdown.value"` becomes `State("dropdown", "value")`.

    # would be inherited by all subclasses.

        This is always called using keyword-arguments so cannot have positional-only arguments.

        Any static arguments should not go explicitly in the function signature but instead be accessed through
        `self`, e.g. `self.file_format`.

        Any runtime arguments that were defined as model fields must go explicitly in the function signature,
        e.g. `country`.

        In addition to the runtime arguments specified as model fields, you can also use the following built-in
        arguments:
