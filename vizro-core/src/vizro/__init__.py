# For the below _css_dist and _js_dist to be used by Dash, they must be retrieved by dash.resources.Css.get_all_css().
# This means adding them to dash.development.base_component.ComponentRegistry. The simplest way to do this is to run
# ComponentRegistry.registry.add("vizro") and this appears to be sufficient for our needs, but it is not documented
# anywhere. The same function is run (together with some others which we don't need and make things a bit dirty) when
# subclassing Component, thanks to the metaclass ComponentMeta. We used to define a dummy component and do this route,
# even though we don't need the component for anything, but it's cleaner to do ComponentRegistry.registry.add("vizro").
# Since we need to *remove* the library resources when Vizro is used as a framework it's also clearer when this gets
# reversed by ComponentRegistry.registry.discard("vizro") in Vizro(). _css_dist and _js_dist is automatically served on
# import of vizro, regardless of whether the Vizro class or any other bits are used.
