### Highlights ✨

- The `vizro.themes` module is now public, providing direct access to Vizro's carefully designed, colorblind-safe color system and palettes. Users can import individual colors via `vizro.themes.colors` and access pre-configured color scales through `vizro.themes.palettes`, including qualitative, sequential, and diverging palettes. See the [themes user guide](https://vizro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/user-guides/themes/#vizro-colors-and-palettes) and [API reference](https://vizro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/API-reference/themes/) for details.
