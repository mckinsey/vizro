## What is Vizro?

<p align="center">
<font size="+1">
Rapidly self-serve the assembly of customised dashboards in minutes - without the need for advanced design or coding experience - to create flexible and scalable data science ready, Python based data visualization applications.
</font>
</p>

Use a few lines of simple configuration to create complex dashboards, which are automatically assembled utilising libraries such as **Plotly** and **Dash**.

Define high level categories within the configuration, including:

- **components:** create charts, tables, input/output interfaces, and more
- **controls**: create filters, parameter inputs, and custom action controllers
- **pages, layouts and navigation**: create multiple pages, with customisable layouts and flexible navigation across them
- **actions and interactions**: create interactions between charts, and use pre-defined or customised actions (such as exporting)

Configuration can be written in multiple formats including **Pydantic models**, **JSON**, **YAML** or **Python dictionaries** for added flexibility of implementation.

<br/>

### Key benefits

Vizro provides a low-code configuration with inbuilt best practices, allowing users to rapidly self-serve the assembly of powerful dashboards in minutes - without the need for advanced design or coding experience.

Optional high-code extensions allow almost infinite customisation in a modular way, combining the best of low-code and high-code - for flexible and scalable data science ready, Python based data visualization applications.
