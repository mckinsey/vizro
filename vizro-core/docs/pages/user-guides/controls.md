# Controls

Vizro has a range of controls to make it simple to add common functionality to your app:

- **[Filters](filters.md)**: control the data loaded into any component on the page.

- **[Parameters](parameters.md)**: dynamically control the values and settings provided to any component on the page.

- **[Selectors](selectors.md)**: include a range of common control interfaces such as drop-down menus and sliders, which can be used for filters or parameters.
