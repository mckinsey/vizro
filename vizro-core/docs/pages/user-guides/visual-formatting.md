# How to customize the style of Vizro dashboards

Vizro has a default styling to help users with no design experience get started.
There are several options if you want to customize the style:

* **[Configure the `Layout`](layouts.md)**: Customize the arrangement of your components inside your Vizro dashboard.

* **[Apply a theme](themes.md)**: Choose between a dark or light theme.

* **[Manage assets](assets.md)**: Enhance your dashboard by adding images, scripts, and stylesheets to your assets folder.

* **[Customize CSS](custom-css.md)**: Incorporate custom CSS to deviate from the default styling and create a
unique appearance for your Vizro dashboard.

* **[Customize your `component`](components.md)**: Change the appearance of components like the [Graph](graph.md), the
[Table](table.md) and the [AgGrid](table.md), by passing extra arguments. Refer to the relevant user guide for
more details.
