# How to customize the style of Vizro dashboards

Vizro comes with a default styling aimed at helping users with no design experience get started quickly. 
However, if you wish to customize further, there are several options available:

* **[Configure the `Layout`](layouts.md)**: You can customize the layout of your Vizro dashboard to better suit your needs. This includes configuring the arrangement of your components to create a more effective and visually appealing dashboard.


* **[Apply a theme](themes.md)**: Vizro allows you to apply different themes to your dashboard, providing a cohesive and professional look and feel. You can currently select from dark and light theme.


* **[Add images and stylesheets to your assets folder](assets.md)**: You can manage and customize assets such as images, scripts, and stylesheets to enhance the functionality and appearance of your dashboard.


* **[Customize CSS](custom-css.md)**. You can add custom CSS to any Vizro dashboard, enabling users to deviate from the default styling and create a unique look and feel for their dashboard.
