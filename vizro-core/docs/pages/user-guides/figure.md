# How to use figures

This guide shows you how to add any dash component to Vizro that needs to be reactive to controls or actions in your page.
If you want to add a static dash component to your page, use [custom components](custom-components.md) instead.

A [`Figure`][vizro.models.Figure] is a versatile model that allows you to wrap any Dash component that doesn't fit into the more specialized
reactive components like [`Graph`][vizro.models.Graph], [`Table`][vizro.models.Table], [AgGrid][vizro.models.AgGrid].
In essence, `Figure` is a higher-level abstraction, providing a flexible foundation for all types of visual components in Vizro.

The `Graph`, `Table` and `AgGrid` are specific implementations of the Â´Figure` model. They serve as intuitive shortcuts
for common dashboard components, embedding behaviors and interactions specific to their purposes.

The following flowchart shows what you need to consider when choosing which model to use:

``` mermaid
graph TD
  first["`Does the dash component you want to add exist in our components library already?`"]
  extend-component([Use our existing components and enhance them if required])
  second["`Does the new dash component need to be reactive to controls or actions?`"]
  second-static([Use custom components])
  second-reactive([Use Figure and provide a custom function])

  first -- Yes --> extend-component
  first -- No --> second
  second -- No --> second-static
  second -- Yes --> second-reactive

  click second-static href "../custom-components/#create-a-new-component"
  click second-reactive href "#how-to-use-figures"

```
Essentially: Use the `Figure` model when you need to include a custom Dash component that needs to be reactive to controls or actions on your page
and cannot be included using the `Graph`, `Table` or `AgGrid` models.

To add a `Figure` to your page, do the following:

- add the `Figure` model to the components argument of the [Page][vizro.models.Page] model.
- use one of the currently available figure functions from `vizro.figures` or create your own custom function, and pass it to the `figure` argument of the `Figure` model.
