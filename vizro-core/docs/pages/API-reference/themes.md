# Themes

API reference for Vizro's carefully designed, colorblind-safe color system and palettes. The `vizro.themes` module contains `colors` and `palettes` that can be used both inside and outside Vizro dashboards. The how-to guide on [themes](../user-guides/themes.md#vizro-colors-and-palettes) contains more information.

::: vizro.themes
    options:
      filters: ["!^_"]  # Don't show dunder methods as well as single underscore ones
      members:
        - colors
        - palettes

**Visual reference**

Below is a visual reference of all available Vizro colors and palettes. Each color and palette is labeled with its access name, e.g. `colors.cyan_100` for individual colors or `palettes.sequential_cyan` for complete palettes.
