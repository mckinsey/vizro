## Which browsers does Vizro support?

Vizro supports the [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/). Other browsers may work, but are not officially supported.

## What is the Vizro versioning policy?

This project adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). We do not consider frontend changes (such as changing the appearance of a component) to be breaking changes.

!!! note

    While being in version `0.x.x`, we may introduce breaking changes in minor versions.

## Where can I find example dashboards?

For a gallery of examples showing Vizro in action, take a look at [vizro.mckinsey.com](https://vizro.mckinsey.com). The gallery links to the [Vizro HuggingFace collection](https://huggingface.co/vizro), which includes complete code accessed for each example by selecting "Files" in the top right menu.

We also maintain a separate, curated page of [videos, blog posts, and examples of Vizro usage from our community](your-examples.md).

## How does Vizro work under the hood?

This documentation is designed mostly for users of Vizro, but if you're interested in how Vizro works, we recommend heading over to the auto-generated [DeepWiki pages](https://deepwiki.com/mckinsey/vizro) for insight into Vizro's architecture, dashboard model, page model, and more. These pages are created using generative AI by a third party outside of Vizro.

## Why should I use Vizro?

Vizro is a high-level framework built on top of Dash and Pydantic, which makes it easier to build advanced dashboards since it automates many of the otherwise complex and time-consuming tasks traditionally associated with designing, building and deploying front-end applications, from prototypes to production.

### You can build beautiful & powerful dashboards, quickly & easily

Users can configure Vizro dashboards without needing to know advanced software development principles, nor how to build front-end applications.

    <figcaption>less than 30 lines of configuration can create dashboards with multiple charts and filters</figcaption>
    </figure>

    - **Beautiful** - inbuilt visual design best practices are applied automatically, so users can create beautiful dashboards without needing to know any HTML, CSS or design principles.
    - **Powerful** - advanced functionality and interactions come out-of-the-box, by using just a few lines of simple configuration.
    - **Quick and easy** - the simple configuration follows an intuitive "grammar of dashboards" which is quick to learn and easy to use. This removes most of the "glue code" that would otherwise need to be written. Thousands of lines of code are reduced to tens of lines of configuration. Users can configure Vizro dashboards without needing to know any advanced software development principles of how to build front-end applications.

### You can extend and customize infinitely

Users benefit from the power of the Dash framework and the flexibility of React.

??? details "See more details"

    - **Dash** - since Vizro is built on top of Dash, then users benefit from all the underlying power and customizations offered by the Dash framework, including the ability to use extension libraries related to Dash.
    - **React** - since Dash enables JavaScript React components to be incorporated into Dash applications, Vizro users can create custom charts and UI components which offer the infinite flexibility of React.
    - **Vizro extensions** - adding extensions such as user defined custom charts, components, actions and data connectors is intuitively incorporated into the configuration language of Vizro.

### You can rapidly scale from prototypes to production deployment

Consistency and re-usability designed for scale.

??? details "See more details"

    - **Prototype rapidly** - even complex dashboards can be created within minutes using Vizro, which enables prototype dashboards to be created and iterated on quickly and easily, with very low barrier to entry.
    - **Deploy easily** - since Vizro is built on Dash which uses Flask, it is simple to deploy Vizro like any other Dash application, and use application servers such as Gunicorn to scale to multiple users.
    - **Scale** - since Vizro offers standardization of visual design, application architecture and configuration language, it is easier to scale across multiple developers, projects and implementations in a consistent and reusable way.

## How does Vizro differ from Dash or Streamlit?

Potential users sometimes request comparisons between Vizro and similar tools such as Dash and Streamlit. In many ways a direct comparison is not possible as these products tackle somewhat different use cases and their relative pros and cons change depending on the particular requirements of each different user.

Any attempt at a high-level explanation must rely on an oversimplification that misses many important nuances. With the caveat that it's not possible to "compare apples with pears", and that any comparison will have a different conclusion for different users, an oversimplified view could be:

??? details "Streamlit is great for rapid prototyping"

    - **rapid prototyping** - Streamlit's architecture allows you to write apps the same way you write plain Python scripts. To unlock this, Streamlit apps have a unique data flow: any time something must be updated on the screen, Streamlit reruns your entire Python script from top to bottom. [[1]](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/main-concepts) This turns data scripts into sharable web apps in minutes. [[2]](https://streamlit.io/) Adding a widget is the same as declaring a variable. (No need to write a backend, define routes, handle HTTP requests, connect a frontend, write HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. [[3]](https://streamlit.io/))

??? details "Dash is great for customization and scalability"

    - **customization** - one of the great things about Dash is that it is built on top of React.js, a JavaScript library for building web components. Thousands of components have been built and released with open source licenses by the React community, any of which could be adapted into a Dash component. [[4]](https://dash.plotly.com/plugins) Dash supports adding custom CSS [[5]](https://dash.plotly.com/external-resources) and HTML, callbacks for custom behavior, and many component libraries such as Dash Bootstrap components [[6]](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/)
    - **scalability** - based on Flask which is widely adopted by the Python community and deployed in production environments everywhere [[7]](https://medium.com/plotly/introducing-dash-5ecf7191b503) Dash was designed to be a stateless framework. Stateless frameworks are more scalable and robust [[8]](https://dash.plotly.com/sharing-data-between-callbacks#why-share-state?)

??? details "Vizro is great for combining rapid prototyping with customization and scalability"

    - **rapid prototyping** - since Vizro is a high-level framework providing declarative configuration, it is quick and easy to create powerful interactive apps in minutes, without needing to write callbacks, HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Key topics such as applying state management, application architecture, and testing are done automatically by Vizro.
    - **customization and scalability** - since Vizro is built on top of Dash, then users benefit from all the underlying power of the Dash framework for customization and scalability
    - **beauty and robustness** - since Vizro uses inbuilt visual design and software development best practices, it automatically generates dashboards which look beautiful and can go from prototype to production quickly and easily

All are great entry points to the world of data apps. If you prefer a top-down scripting style, then Streamlit is a powerful approach. If you prefer full control and customization over callbacks and layouts, then Dash is a powerful approach. If you prefer a configuration approach with in-built best practices, and the potential for customization and scalability through Dash, then Vizro is a powerful approach.

For a more detailed comparison, it may help to read introductory articles about [Dash](https://medium.com/plotly/introducing-dash-5ecf7191b503), [Streamlit](https://blog.streamlit.io/streamlit-101-python-data-app/) and [Vizro](https://quantumblack.medium.com/introducing-vizro-a-toolkit-for-creating-modular-data-visualization-applications-3a42f2bec4db), to see how each tool serves a distinct purpose.

## How does Vizro compare with Python packages and business intelligence (BI) tools?

There are a number of Python packages and BI tools which offer support for visualization applications (such as Streamlit, Plotly/Dash, Tableau and PowerBI).

Vizro is intended to support several niches between the benefits from those tools, rather than being in direct comparison with any single tool. Therefore, direct comparisons are often only partially suitable, given the many features offered across this landscape.

However, in general, there are several areas of functionality where Vizro can be particularly useful, such as in providing a simple configuration to speed up the assembly of components, leveraging inbuilt visual design, application architecture, and coding standards, along with the ability to scale easily across multiple developers and implementations.

## When would an alternative to Vizro be more suitable?

There are a number of cases where alternatives to Vizro may be more suitable, including:

- where BI tools are already in heavy use and working well, and/or Python developers are not prevalent

- where development teams already contain designers and JavaScript (or equivalent) engineers with bandwidth to build bespoke applications (though Vizro can sometimes still be used effectively to rapidly prototype potential solutions)

- where Python developers are already very comfortable leveraging other Python packages
