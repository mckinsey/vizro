# Why Vizro

In the context of comparison with other visualization packages or business intelligence tools, Vizro combines benefits of the speed and user-friendliness of low-code visual analytics tools with the flexibility and power of high-code tools - whilst providing inbuilt visual design, application architecture and coding standardization which also facilitates scaling and reusability.

The simple and largely declarative configuration language follows a “grammar of dashboards” which makes the creation of complex dashboards more intuitive. This leverages modular components, empowering users to rapidly self-serve the assembly of customized dashboards with inbuilt visual styling in minutes, and reduces the amount of “glue code” required, whilst still retaining the ability to enhance functionality almost infinitely through customization and extensions, with standardization increasing the consistency across outputs.

Using configuration rather than a GUI to define the output facilitates collaboration during the creation process, and increases reusability and scalability in a Python setting.

The largely tech-agnostic configuration driven assembly enables utilizing a range of tools, and an inbuilt validation layer provides meaningful feedback to users about configuration choices, thereby increasing flexibility and ease of use.

## In relation to Python packages and business intelligence tools

There are a number of Python packages and business intelligence tools which provide support for visualization applications (such as Streamlit, Plotly/Dash, Tableau and PowerBI).

Vizro is intended to support several niches between the benefits provided by those tools, rather than being in direct comparison to any single tool. Therefore, direct comparisons are often only partially suitable, given the many features offered across this landscape.

However, in general, there are several areas of functionality where Vizro can be particularly useful, e.g., in providing a simple configuration to speed up the assembly of components, leveraging inbuilt visual design, application architecture, and coding standards,
along with the ability to scale easily across multiple developers and implementations:

| Scaling                                               | - The consistency in visual design, application architecture and code standards, combined with the ease of collaboration between Python developers, allows scaling within and between projects by facilitating re-use, extension and programmatic updates of configurations                                                | - Sections of configuration can be re-used and tailored easily, allowing implementations to scale across or between projects. <br> - New joiners to a team can get up to speed quickly, allowing teams to scale in size. <br> - Other teams can inherit configurations easily, allowing implementations to scale between teams. <br> - Updates can be propagated to configurations from a central location, allowing adjustments and updates to scale easily across large implementations. <br> - Inbuilt visual design decisions provide visual consistency. <br> - Leveraging collaborative coding mechanisms such as Git enables almost any number of developers to collaborate effectively. | Many Python packages benefit from the ability to propagate updates programmatically, while applying that to “glue code”. Vizro makes it easy to scale by replicating the relatively small amount of configuration in 1 file between usages, rather than replicating a large amount of code across many files between usages. Updating configuration programmatically from a central location is often easier than updating code. When sharing between users, it can be easier to inherit and understand configuration than the underlying code. The visual consistency makes it easier to scale within or between projects while maintaining visual coherence | Many BI tools allow scaling through GUI drag-and-drop interfaces (having some functionality for duplication or propagating changes) for single users. Vizro makes it easy to leverage tools such as Git to enable almost any number of users to collaborate effectively, therefore allowing the number of developers on a single project to scale easily. Since updates can be propagated programmatically easily from a central location, it allows scaling across almost any number of related implementations which can be kept up to date and aligned without the need to manually adjust each implementation when updates are required |

## Cases where alternatives to Vizro are potentially more suitable

There are a number of cases where alternatives to Vizro may be more suitable, including (but not limited to):

- cases where BI tools are already in use, and/or Python users are not prevalent (if the goals of users are already supported)

- cases where a development team already contains designers and javascript (or equivalent) engineers able and willing to build bespoke applications (though Vizro can sometimes still be used effectively to rapidly prototype potential solutions)

- cases where Python developers are already comfortable leveraging other Python packages without the desire to use an assembly system, or do not require inbuilt visual design, application architecture or coding standards, and/or the ability to scale easily across multiple implementations or users
