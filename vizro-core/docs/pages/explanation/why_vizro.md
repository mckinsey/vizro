# Why Vizro

In the context of comparison with other visualization packages or business intelligence tools, Vizro combines benefits of the speed and user-friendliness of low-code visual analytics tools with the flexibility and power of high-code tools - whilst providing inbuilt visual design, application architecture and coding standardization which also facilitates scaling and reusability.

The simple and largely declarative configuration language follows a “grammar of dashboards” which makes the creation of complex dashboards more intuitive. This leverages modular components, empowering users to rapidly self-serve the assembly of customized dashboards with inbuilt visual styling in minutes, and reduces the amount of “glue code” required, whilst still retaining the ability to enhance functionality almost infinitely through customization and extensions, with standardization increasing the consistency across outputs.

Using configuration rather than a GUI to define the output facilitates collaboration during the creation process, and increases reusability and scalability in a Python setting.

The largely tech-agnostic configuration driven assembly enables utilizing a range of tools, and an inbuilt validation layer provides meaningful feedback to users about configuration choices, thereby increasing flexibility and ease of use.

## Python packages and business intelligence (BI) tools

There are a number of Python packages and BI tools which provide support for visualization applications (such as Streamlit, Plotly/Dash, Tableau and PowerBI).

Vizro is intended to support several niches between the benefits provided by those tools, rather than being in direct comparison with any single tool. Therefore, direct comparisons are often only partially suitable, given the many features offered across this landscape.

However, in general, there are several areas of functionality where Vizro can be particularly useful, e.g., in providing a simple configuration to speed up the assembly of components, leveraging inbuilt visual design, application architecture, and coding standards,
along with the ability to scale easily across multiple developers and implementations:

## Cases where alternatives to Vizro are potentially more suitable

There are a number of cases where alternatives to Vizro may be more suitable, including where:

- BI tools are already in use, and/or Python developers are not prevalent

- Development teams already contain designers and JavaScript (or equivalent) engineers able and willing to build bespoke applications (though Vizro can sometimes still be used effectively to rapidly prototype potential solutions)

- Python developers are already comfortable leveraging other Python packages without the desire to use an assembly system, or do not require inbuilt visual design, application architecture or coding standards, and/or the ability to scale easily across multiple implementations or users
