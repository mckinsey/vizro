# A first dashboard

There is no setup needed for your first dashboard, thanks to the amazing [Py.Cafe](https://py.cafe/).

Follow the [Edit live on Py.Cafe](https://py.cafe/maxi.schulz/vizro-tutorial-first-dashboard) link below the dashboard to see the code and experiment with it.

## Can I break your code?
When you click the link to "Edit live on Py.Cafe" the dashboard is running inside your browser. Any changes you make are local and you don't need to worry about breaking the code for others. Nobody else sees the changes you make unless you save a copy of the project as your own Vizro py.cafe project.

## How can I make my own dashboards?
You can use [Py.Cafe](https://py.cafe/) to experiment with your own Vizro dashboards by dropping code onto a new project.

If you need inspiration or a starting point, we make all our examples available for you to try out on Py.Cafe. In the documentation, look out for the "Edit live on Py.Cafe links" below the code snippets.

## Where next?
You are now ready to explore Vizro further, by working through the ["Explore Vizro" tutorial](explore-components.md) or by consulting the [how-to guides](../user-guides/dashboard.md).
