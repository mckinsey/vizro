# Your examples

This page lists the examples we've found and liked that use Vizro, including videos, blog posts and dashboard code.

This page is a bit like [Awesome-Kedro](https://github.com/kedro-org/awesome-kedro) in that it covers a set of Vizro-related third party content.


The text that introduces the page explains that the Vizro team curate the list so if you spot something that we should include, let us know by emailing (made-up-vizro-email @quantumblack.com) or making an issue and we will make a PR to add the example. Or point to the contribution process and suggest they create a PR on the page with the item they want to add.

We should also note that we don't take responsibility for third party content and haven't tested it to ensure it works at the time of publication nor with later releases of Vizro.
