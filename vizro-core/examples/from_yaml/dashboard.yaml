          ### Overview
          The world map provides initial insights into the variations of metrics across countries and
          continents. Click on Play to see the animation and explore the development over time.

          #### Observation
          A global trend of increasing life expectancy emerges, with some exceptions in specific African countries.
          Additionally, despite similar population growth rates across continents, the overall global population
          continues to expand, with India and China leading the way.  Meanwhile, GDP per capita experiences growth in
          most regions.

          ### Distribution
          The boxplot illustrates the distribution of each metric across continents, facilitating comparisons of life
          expectancy, GDP per capita, and population statistics.

          #### Observation
          Observations reveal that Europe and Oceania have the highest life expectancy and GDP per capita, likely
          influenced by their smaller population growth. Additionally, Asia and America exhibit notable GDP per capita
          outliers, indicating variations among countries within these continents or large growth over the observed
          years.

          ### Development
          The line chart tracks the variable's progress from 1952 to 2007, facilitating a deeper comprehension of each
          metric.

          #### Observation
          Oceania and Europe are found to have the highest total GDP per capita and exhibit significant growth. In
          contrast, Asia, Africa, and America demonstrate a more pronounced upward trend in population increase compared
          to Europe and Oceania, suggesting that GDP per capita growth might be influenced by relatively smaller
          population growth in the latter two continents.

          ### Recent status
          Examining the data for 2007 provides insight into the current status of each continent and metrics.

          #### Observation
          Asia held the largest population, followed by America, Europe, Africa, and Oceania. Life expectancy surpassed
          70 years for all continents, except Africa with 55 years. GDP per capita aligns with earlier findings, with
          Oceania and Europe reporting the highest values and Africa recording the lowest.

          Population, GDP per capita, and life expectancy are interconnected metrics that provide insights into the
          socio-economic well-being of a country. Rapid population growth can strain resources and infrastructure,
          impacting GDP per capita. Higher GDP per capita often enables better healthcare and improved life expectancy,
          but other factors such as healthcare quality and social policies also play significant roles.

          ### Africa
          ![](assets/images/continents/africa.svg#my-image)

          Africa, a diverse and expansive continent, faces both challenges and progress in its socio-economic landscape.
          In 2007, Africa's GDP per capita was approximately $3,000, reflecting relatively slower growth compared to
          other continents like Oceania and Europe.

          However, Africa has shown notable improvements in life expectancy over time, reaching 55 years in 2007.
          Despite these economic disparities, Africa's population has been steadily increasing, reflecting its
          significant potential for development.

          Comprising North and South America, Americas represents a region of vast geographical and cultural diversity.
          In 2007, the continent experienced substantial population growth, with a diverse mix of countries contributing
          to this expansion.

          Although its GDP per capita of $11,000 in 2007 exhibited variations across countries, America maintained
          similar levels to Asia, reflecting its economic significance. With North America generally reporting higher
          life expectancy compared to South America, America remains a region of opportunities and challenges.

          ### Asia
          ![](assets/images/continents/asia.svg#my-image)

          Asia holds a central role in the global economy. It's growth in GDP per capita to $12,000 in 2007 and
          population has been significant, outpacing many other continents. In 2007, it boasted the highest population
          among all continents, with countries like China and India leading the way.

          Despite facing various socio-economic challenges, Asia's increasing life expectancy from 46 years to 70 over
          the years reflects advancements in healthcare and overall well-being, making it a vital region driving global
          progress and development.

          ### Europe
          ![](assets/images/continents/europe.svg#my-image)

          Europe boasts a strong and thriving economy. In 2007, it exhibited the second-highest GDP per capita of
          $25,000 among continents, indicating sustained economic growth and development.

          Europe's life expectancy surpassed 75 years, showcasing a high standard of living and well-established
          healthcare systems. With its robust infrastructure, advanced industries, and quality of life, Europe continues
          to be a leading force in the global economy. Between 1952 and 2007, Europe's population experienced moderate
          growth, with a factor of approximately 1.5, notably lower compared to other continents like Asia and America.

          Oceania, comprising countries like Australia and New Zealand, stands out with notable economic prosperity and
          longer life expectancy. In 2007, it boasted the highest GDP per capita of $27,000 among continents and
          exhibited one of the highest life expectancy levels, surpassing 80 years.

          Despite a relatively smaller population size, Oceania's strong economic growth has contributed to improved
          living standards and overall well-being of its population.
