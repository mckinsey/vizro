# Chart gallery dashboard

This demo dashboard provides a gallery of charts. It includes guidance on when to use each chart type and sample code
to create them using Plotly and Vizro.

## How to run the example locally

1. If you have `hatch` set up, run the example with the command `hatch run example charts`. Otherwise, run the `app.py` file with your environment activated where `vizro` is installed.
2. You should now be able to access the app locally via http://127.0.0.1:8050/.
