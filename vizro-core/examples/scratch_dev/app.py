Notes:
* How to handle different types? See options below.
* How can user easily write in chat function that plugs in?
* Streaming is not easy... Let's forget about it for now as a built-in feature, save it for fancy demos and then come
back to trying to build it in.

If get message history from server then need to hook into OPL for it. Could be whole separate action from OPL since 
it doesn't involve Figures. Could do this with OpenAI but looks like it's potentially several requests due to 
pagination.
If get message history from local then still need to populate somehow but not in OPL - could all be clientside and 
outside actions. Probably easier overall.
Use previous_response_id stored locally so there's possibility in future of moving message population to serverside.

Can't use previous_response_id internally:
Previous response cannot be used for this organization due to Zero Data Retention. 

Options for handling messages/prompt:
- messages as input property to do Dash component. Then don't need JSON duplication of it in store. Handle different 
return types in Dash component rather than purely returning Dash components as here. Effectively this is done by 
store_to_html callback in this example. Still easier to do this way than Dash component, regardless of whether it's 
SS or CS callback. Could maybe have user write function that plugs in to do render of message? Conclusion: do the 
Dash stuff SS by hand for response updating message output. Remember SS callbacks will have no problems at all for local use so not such a big compromise.
But need to work with streaming too so can't be done in callback - must be returned at same time as store, 
so option 3 only realistic possibility. 
- JSON store version that produces HTML version with SSCB. Ways to update this:
  - Option 1: prompt trigger updates store and triggers OpenAI callback at same time.
  - Option 2: prompt trigger updates store which then is trigger for OpenAI callback
  - Option 3: update HTML at same time as store. Then have duplicated data which is inelegant but not a big problem. 
  Also makes on_page_load serverside - also not big problem. This is done here.

Things to improve in nearish future:
- need to specify chat_id manually
- way to plug into OPL if want to retrieve messages from server. Not urgent if do it all clientside. But now that 
translation of store messages to html is SS, need to be able to do this. Options:
   - plug into OPL properly somehow
   - write another callback here that is triggered by {ON_PAGE_LOAD_ACTION_PREFIX}_{page.id}. Done here in hacky way
