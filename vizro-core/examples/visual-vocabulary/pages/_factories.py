                #### What is a butterfly chart?

                A butterfly chart (also called a tornado chart) is a bar chart for displaying two sets of data series
                side by side.

                &nbsp;

                #### When should I use it?

                Use a butterfly chart when you wish to emphasize the comparison between two data sets sharing the same
                parameters. Sharing this chart with your audience will help them see at a glance how two groups differ
                within the same parameters. You can also **stack** two bars on each side to divide your
                categories.

                #### What is a connected scatter chart?

                A connected scatter chart visualizes two variables (x and y) using dots, with lines connecting the dots
                in the order of the data points. One variable is plotted along the x-axis and the other along the
                y-axis, showing both the relationship and a sequence of the data.

                &nbsp;

                #### When should I use it?

                Use connected scatter charts to show the relationship between two variables and the sequence of data
                points. They are ideal for paired numerical data, helping to reveal trends and patterns over time or in
                a specific order. Remember, correlation is not causation, so ensure your audience understands this to
                avoid misinterpretation.

                A combined column and line chart helps you demonstrate the relationship between an amount
                (displayed in columns) and a trend or rate (displayed as a line running across the columns).

                Use this type of chart when you wish to compare quantities of one item with changes in another item.
                It's ideal for showing patterns over time (e.g., monthly sales and growth rates) but can also be used
                for other types of data comparisons.

                #### What is a waterfall chart?

                A waterfall chart is a bar chart that shows the cumulative effect of sequential positive or negative
                values. It starts with an initial value, displays individual changes as steps, and ends with the
                final total.

                &nbsp;

                #### When should I use it?

                Use a waterfall chart to visualize how individual factors contribute to a total, such as changes in
                revenue or costs by category. It helps you understand the incremental impact of each factor, making
                data analysis and interpretation easier. Ensure all bars and changes are clearly labeled, use consistent
                colors for positive and negative values, and arrange categories logically to tell a coherent story.
