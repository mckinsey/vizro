# KPI dashboard

This demo dashboard provides an example of a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dashboard, designed to help users get started and extend further.
It uses fictional budget data to demonstrate the capabilities of Vizro using real world applications.

Special thanks to the [#RWFD Real World Fake Data initiative](https://opendatainitiative.io/), a community project that
provides high-quality fake data for creating realistic dashboard examples for real-world applications.

Note: The data has been additionally been edited for the purpose of this example.

## How to run the example locally

1. Download the `Financial Consumer Complaints.csv` file from [this link](https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Financial+Consumer+Complaints.csv) and place it in the `data` folder
2. If you have `hatch` set up, run the example with the command `hatch run example kpi`. Otherwise, run the `app.py` file with your environment activated where `vizro` is installed.
3. You should now be able to access the app locally via http://127.0.0.1:8050/.
