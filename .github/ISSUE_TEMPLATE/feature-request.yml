        Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to fill in this feature request form.
        It will be a valuable contribution to Vizro.

        We'd appreciate it if you could search on Vizro's existing issues prior to filing
        a feature request to avoid any duplicate tickets, as we have limited maintainer capacity to triage
        them. Thanks!
