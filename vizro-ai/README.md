## Why Vizro-AI?

### Easy-to-use

One of the key strengths of Vizro-AI lies in its natural language capabilities, making it accessible to coding novices. Vizro-AI provides a user-friendly interface that allows to create interactive charts while offering detailed insights about the data and the generated code.

### Visually-optimized

Vizro-AI also caters to data practitioners who often find themselves spending more time in formatting rather than actual visualization creation. Vizro-AI enables users to speed up the process of creating visually appealing charts by using Vizro's themes which incorporate design best practices by default.

### Dashboard-ready

Vizro-AI leverages the power of [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) to produce interactive charts, making it easier to seamlessly integrate these generated charts directly into dashboard applications.
