# Retrieve the code of Vizro-AI generated dashboard

!!! warning "Feature in Alpha Version"
    This feature is currently in **Alpha** version. It is stable but not officially released yet. We welcome feedback via the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mckinsey/vizro/issues). Note that the feature and its API may still undergo minor adjustments.

This guide shows how to retrieve the code of a Vizro-AI generated dashboard. The code can be used for further iterations, improvements and deployment.

While Vizro-AI can follow complex user requirements well and generate high-quality dashboards, due to the nature of LLMs, the generated dashboards often only approximately match user expectations. Besides refining the user prompt and re-running Vizro-AI, you can also extract the code and iterate manually to achieve the desired result.


## 1. Prepare the data and user prompt
```py
import vizro.plotly.express as px

df = px.data.tips()

user_question = """
Create a one-page dashboard layout with the following components:

1. Card:
   - Position: Left of the page
   - Size: Takes up 1/4 of the total page width
   - Content: Display the text "This is Tips dataset"

2. Table:
   - Position: Right of the card
   - Size: Takes up the remaining 3/4 of the page width
   - Content: Display the Tips dataset
"""
```

## 2. Generate and launch the dashboard
```py
result = vizro_ai._dashboard([df], user_question, return_elements=True)
```
This will trigger the dashboard building process. Once Vizro-AI finishes the dashboard generation process, you can now launch the dashboard.

!!! example "Generated dashboard"

    === "Code"
        ```py
        Vizro().build(result.dashboard).run()
        ```

    === "Result"

## 3. Retrieve the Python code of the dashboard
!!! example "View dashboard code"

    === "Code"
        ```py
        print(result.code)
        ```

    === "Result"
