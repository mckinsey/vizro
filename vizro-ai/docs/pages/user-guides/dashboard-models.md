# How to choose the right model for dashboard creation task

=== "OpenAI"

    - gpt-3.5-turbo `default`: Ideal for smaller requests and simple specifications. However, due to the complexity of dashboard creation, `gpt-3.5-turbo` often produces incomplete responses for larger tasks.
    - gpt-4-turbo: Excels in dashboard creation tasks, providing the most reliable and complete responses.
    - gpt-4o: Performance is inconsistent. The dashboard creation workflow heavily depends on the model's ability to generate structured output, which `gpt-4o` struggles with. As a result, it often fails to provide responses with the correct schema, leading to dashboard building failures.
