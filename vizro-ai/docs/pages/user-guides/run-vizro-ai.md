# Run Vizro-AI

This guide offers insights into different ways of running Vizro-AI code, including within a Jupyter Notebook, as a Python script, or through integration into an application.

## Jupyter Notebook
To run Vizro-AI code in a Jupyter Notebook, create a new cell and execute the code below to render the described visualization as output.

??? note "Note: API key"

    Make sure you have followed the [LLM setup guide](../user-guides/install.md#set-up-access-to-a-large-language-model) and thatyour api key is set up in a `.env` file in the same folder as your Notebook file (`.ipynb`).

!!! example "Ask Vizro-AI to generate a bar chart"

    === "Code for the cell"
        ```py
        import vizro.plotly.express as px
        from vizro_ai import VizroAI

        vizro_ai = VizroAI()

        df = px.data.gapminder()
        fig = vizro_ai.plot(df, "visualize the life expectancy per continent and color each continent")
        fig.show()
        ```
    === "Result"

Note that if you run this code, its appearance may not precisely resemble the one displayed, as it is generated by a generative AI and can vary.

## Python script
You can use Vizro-AI in any standard development environment by creating a `.py` file and executing the code, which displays the output in a browser window.

??? note "Note: API key"

    Make sure you have followed [LLM setup guide](../user-guides/install.md#set-up-access-to-a-large-language-model) and that your API key is set up in the environment where your `.py` script is running with command as below:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your api key"
    ```

!!! example "Ask Vizro-AI to generate a line chart"

    === "example.py"
        ```py
        import vizro.plotly.express as px
        from vizro_ai import VizroAI

        vizro_ai = VizroAI()

        df = px.data.gapminder()
        fig = vizro_ai.plot(df, "describe life expectancy per continent over time")
        fig.show()
        ```
    === "Result"

## Application integration

You may prefer to integrate Vizro-AI into an application that offers a UI for users to input prompts.

There are two ways to integrate Vizro-AI into an application: directly and by accessing the chart code behind a `fig` object.

1. Vizro-AI's `plot` method returns a `plotly.graph_objects` object (`fig`) that can be used directly within a `Vizro` dashboard.

    !!! example "Direct application integration"

        === "app.py"
            ```py
            import vizro.plotly.express as px
            from vizro_ai import VizroAI

            vizro_ai = VizroAI()

            df = px.data.gapminder()
            fig = vizro_ai.plot(df, "describe life expectancy per continent over time")
            ```


2. When the `return_elements` argument of VizroAI's `plot` method is set to `True`, the method returns a `PlotOutputs` data class which contains all possible `VizroAI.plot()` outputs.
By setting `return_elements=True` you can access code or the figure object. Vizro-AI validates the code to ensure that it is executable and can be integrated.

    !!! example "Accessing outputs from PlotOutputs data class"

        === "app.py"
           ```py
           import vizro_ai
           from vizro_ai import VizroAI
           import vizro.plotly.express as px
           from dotenv import load_dotenv

           load_dotenv()

           df = px.data.gapminder()
           vizro_ai = VizroAI()


The `code_string` returned can be used to dynamically render charts within your application. You may have the option to encapsulate the chart within a `fig` object or convert the figure into a JSON string for further integration.

To use the insights or code explanation, you can use `vizro_ai._run_plot_tasks(df, ..., explain=True)`, which returns a dictionary containing the code explanation and chart insights alongside the code.
           plot_outputs = vizro_ai.plot(df, "describe life expectancy per continent over time", explain=True, return_elements=True)
           fig = plot_outputs.figure
           code_string = plot_outputs.code
           ```


### How to use `max_debug_retry` parameter in plot function
- Default Value: 3
- Type: `int`
- Brief: By default, the `max_debug_retry` is set to 3, the function will try to debug errors up to three times.
If the errors are not resolved after the maximum number of retries, the function will stop further debugging retries.
For example, if you would like adjust to 5 retries, you can set `max_debug_retry = 5` in the plot function:

```py
vizro_ai.plot(df = df, user_input = "your user input", max_debug_retry= 5)
```

### How to use `return_elements` parameter in plot function
- Default Value: False
- Type: `bool`
- Brief: By default, the `return_elements` is set to `False`, and the `VizroAI.plot()` returns a `plotly.graph_objects` object. If `return_elements` is set to `True` `VizroAI.plot()` returns the `PlotOutputs` data class.
The `PlotOutputs` data class is designed to encapsulate all possible outputs generated by the `VizroAI.plot()` method.

Attributes of `PlotOutputs`:

- **`code`**: A string representing of the Python code that manipulates the data and creates the visualization.
- **`figure`**: A [`CapturedCallable`](https://vizro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/API-reference/models/#vizro.models.types.CapturedCallable) object from [`Vizro`](https://vizro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), representing the visual plot generated by `VizroAI.plot()`. This object is designed to run immediately in the Vizro dashboard, but otherwise, it behaves like a plotly `go.Figure`.
- **`business_insights`**: A string containing high-level business insights derived from the plot. `business_insights` is only available if `explain=True`.
- **`code_explanation`**: A string offering a detailed explanation of the code used to produce the plot. `code_explanation` is only available if `explain=True`.
