# Why use Vizro-AI over ChatGPT?

Vizro-AI offers an easy way to turn natural language instructions into professional visualisations, like interactive charts and dashboards, without needing advanced coding skills.

Similar to ChatGPT, Vizro-AI uses generative AI to understand and execute your instructions in English or any other language. However, there are few advantages of using Vizro-AI over ChatGPT.

- **Tailored for data visualisation**: Vizro-AI is specifically designed to create and design charts and dashboards.
- **Enforced design best practices automatically**: Using Vizroâ€™s themes, your visualizations are built with best practices in mind from the start.
- **Instant chart execution**: Vizro-AI generates and executes chart code automatically, allowing you to see the chart output immediately
- **Export options**: Unlike ChatGPT, Vizro-AI enables you to download charts as interactive HTML or JSON files directly through its chart UI hosted on PyCafe.
