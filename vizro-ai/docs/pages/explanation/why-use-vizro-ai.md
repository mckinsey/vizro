# Why use Vizro-AI over ChatGPT?

Vizro-AI offers an easy way to turn natural language instructions into professional visualizations, like interactive charts and dashboards, without needing advanced coding skills.

Like ChatGPT, Vizro-AI uses generative AI to understand and execute your instructions in English, or any other language. However, there are few advantages of using Vizro-AI over ChatGPT.

- **Tailored for data visualization**: Vizro-AI is specifically designed to create charts and dashboards with in-built visual design best practices.
- **Data visualization best practices applied**: Vizroâ€™s chart theme ensures your charts follow many best practices, such as using color-blind friendly colors and maintaining a decluttered design.
- **Data Insights**: Vizro-AI uses advanced prompt engineering to integrate additional context and data-specific insights, enriching your visualizations with more comprehensive information and allowing for more effective data storytelling.
- **Automatic code debugging**: Vizro-AI debugs the generated code, making sure that it is error-free and ready to run.
- **Instant chart execution**: Vizro-AI generates and executes chart code automatically, allowing you to see the chart output immediately.
- **Export options**: Unlike ChatGPT, Vizro-AI enables you to download charts as interactive HTML or JSON files directly through its chart UI hosted on PyCafe.
