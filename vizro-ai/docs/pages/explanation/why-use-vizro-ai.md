# Why use Vizro-AI?

Vizro-AI offers an easy way to turn natural language instructions into professional visualizations, like interactive charts, without needing advanced coding skills.

Vizro-AI uses generative AI to understand and execute your instructions in English, or any other language. Here are the key advantages:

- **Tailored for data visualization**: Vizro-AI is specifically designed to create charts with in-built visual design best practices.
- **Data visualization best practices applied**: Vizro's chart theme ensures your charts follow many best practices, such as using color-blind friendly colors and maintaining a decluttered design.
- **Data Insights**: Vizro-AI uses advanced prompt engineering to integrate extra context and data-specific insights, enriching your visualizations with more comprehensive information and allowing for more effective data storytelling.
- **Automatic code debugging**: Vizro-AI can validate and debug the generated code, making sure that it is error-free and ready to run.
- **Instant chart execution**: Vizro-AI generates and executes chart code automatically, allowing you to see the chart output immediately.
- **Flexible agent architecture**: Built on [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/), Vizro-AI's `chart_agent` supports async execution, streaming, dependency injection, and can be extended with custom tools and instructions.
- **Easy integration**: The `chart_agent` can be integrated into any Python application and works seamlessly with Vizro dashboards.
