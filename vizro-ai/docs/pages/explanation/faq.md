# Frequently asked questions

## Should I use Vizro-AI or Vizro-MCP?

Vizro-AI has largely been replaced by [Vizro-MCP](https://github.com/mckinsey/vizro/blob/main/vizro-mcp/README.md) and only supports chart generation from version 0.4.0.

For chart and dashboard generation, we recommend using [Vizro-MCP](https://github.com/mckinsey/vizro/blob/main/vizro-mcp/README.md). It doesn’t require an API key and works with familiar LLM applications like Claude Desktop, making it simpler to use.
